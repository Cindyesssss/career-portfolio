嘿咦耶咦耶
(主歌)
traveling alone in the world
lonely you are
but you can get your peace of mind
by looking at the stars
(主歌)
traveling the world with me
you'll see people
you'll meet all kinds of people
some of them will be sweet
(副歌)
you'll see the sun and the moon
the stars and the sea
you'll see the sky and the air
you'll be on your way
(主歌)
traveling alone in the world

(主歌)
traveling the world with me
you'll see people
you'll meet all kinds of people
some of them will be sweet
